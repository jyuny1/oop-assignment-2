<glossary><term><lable>layers</lable><define>In a medieval sword and sorcery world, there is one mage who is notorious for her power and grace (at least that's how she likes to put it), Lina Inverse. In reality, she is a teenage mage with a penchant for collateral damage, obnoxiousness and gluttony.
